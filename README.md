## :book:&nbsp; Overview
This is my personal k8s cluster, powered by [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) and k3s based on k8s-at-home's [template](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3s). Incorporates a Proxmox hypervisor for the ol Lenovo TS440 running a hodgepodge of disks.

## :handshake:&nbsp; Thanks

Much thanks to [Kubernetes @Home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/) community for an awesome template, and [onedr0p](https://github.com/onedr0p/home-cluster)'s shining example.
